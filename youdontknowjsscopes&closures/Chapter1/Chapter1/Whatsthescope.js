/*
Most of the chapter talks about how javascript is being interpretated and how it differentiates from a compiled program
normally you would have 3 parts in the classic approach of compiling things up, first you have the tokens and from a lexical approach is taken
then you have the asm or abstract syntax tree and the the optimization a generation of object code 

Then in in javascript way, the simple solution to this is to have only 2 phases and also use other techniques in order to
complete the time constraints that the browser has just in time, and re compiling are some of this tools.
also the 2 phases that im talking about are  parsing and executing.

These topic is really important because it makes the scope topic to be understandable and relatable to the developer

/*Another term the hoisting inside JS makes sense when declaring a value , making all declarations to the top of the scope in order to 
prevent errors
When talking about semantic programming , there are two types the lefgt side target LSR and the right side Target RST
these both refers to a target and a source and it discuss the different type of targets and sources tha Javascript allow

Lexical Scope is the term that reflects how javascript code is compiled this compilation doesnt have any impact on the memory
and also doesnt have nothing to do with the memory allocation
